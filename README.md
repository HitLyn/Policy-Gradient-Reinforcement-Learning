The algorithms we consider include:
1. Episodic REINFORCE (Monte-Carlo) Actor-Critic Stochastic Policy Gradient
2. Stochastic Off-Policy Actor-Critic Policy Gradient
3. Deterministic Policy Gradients
4. Deterministic Gradients with Stochastic Exploration

We consider the following MDPs using a Parameterized Controller (Agent):
1. Toy MDP
2. Grid World (10x10) MDP
3. Mountain Car MDP
4. Cart Pole MDP
5. Pendulum MDP
